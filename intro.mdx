Odigos is an [open-source](https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos) observability control plane.
The project's two main goals are:

1. **Automatic instrumentation** - Odigos automatically instruments your
   applications and produces distributed traces and metrics without any code changes.
2. **Collectors management** - Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to application traffic. No need to
   spend time deploying and configuring collectors.

Odigos supercharges existing observability backends by generating and delivering higher-quality data to the selected backend (Datadog, Grafana, etc).

The name Odigos originates from Greek, meaning guide.

## Who is Odigos for?

- **Application developers** - focus on writing code. Odigos leverages the
  power of OpenTelemetry and eBPF to automatically instrument applications.
  Be prepared for the next production incident with best-in-class observability data.

- **Platform engineers** - Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to the traffic of applications.
  No need to waste time deploying and configuring collectors.
