## Configuring Generic OpenTelemetry Backend

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines Odigos support sending data to any OTLP destinetion.
If your destinetion is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

<Tip>
  Can't find your destinetion in Odigos? Please tell us! We are constantly
  adding new integrations.
