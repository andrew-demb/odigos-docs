On the next page, select Datadog as the destination for the data. You will be
required to fill in the following information:

- **Name**: some unique name for the destination.
- **Site**: This is the domain used for your datadog account, in our exaple it
  is us5.datadoghq.com. (list of available sites)
- **API Key**: The api key created in the previous step.

## Generating data

Thatâ€™s it! Odigos will automatically do the following:

- Instrument all the applications in the cluster:
  - Runtime langauges will be instrumented using OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
  - Compiled languages will be instrumented using eBPF.
- Deploy and configure a collector to send the data to Datadog.

Now all that is left is to generate some traffic in the application. Execute the
following command to port forward into the application UI:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 1234:80 -n default
```

Navigate to http://localhost:1234 and perform some purchases.

## Exploring the collected data

In a few minutes, you should see distributed traces in Datadog APM. You now have
all the data needed to understand how your application is behaving, without
having to do any additional work.

Any new application deployed to this Kubernetes cluster will automatically be
instrumented and sent to Datadog.
